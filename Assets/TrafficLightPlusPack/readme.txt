Welcome to the Traffic Light Plus Pack. Thank you for purchasing this pack and I hope you enjoy it.

Included in this pack are 22 game ready prefabs to add to your street scenes! See the short overview tutorial at https://vimeo.com/reecerobinson/trafficlightplus.

Using the provided modular components you can assemble new Traffic Light configurations if not already provided in this extensive pack.

Like real traffic lights you can choose to configure fully controlled traffic intersections using the scripts provided. You can also manually control each traffic light if that is what you need.

Details: 
 - Physically based materials at 2048x2048 resolution. You can reduce map size as required in Unity3d.
 - All lights use emission texture to visually look illuminated; no game lights are used. You are free to add actual game lights as required.
 - Traffic light automation script provides two modes 
	1) fully automated traffic light sequence for one or two traffic directions, and 
	2) all lights flashing amber/red.
 - Manual control of light phase provided by script when you want to set the light on a phase or just turn to it off.
 
To use these assets, drag out the prefabs as required. Take a look at the example scene and press play to see the assets laid out in an environment.

This is the initial version.
